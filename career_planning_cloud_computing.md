Exploring Emerging Technology Domain : Cloud Computing

1. Technology Overview: The Cloud Computing Model
Cloud Computing is the on-demand availability of computer system resources—especially data storage (cloud storage) and computing power—without direct active management by the user. These services are typically delivered over the internet (the "Cloud") on a pay-as-you-go basis.
Key Service Models
Model	Description	Analogy
IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service)	Provides fundamental computing resources (virtual machines, networks, storage). User manages the OS and applications.	Renting an empty apartment.
PaaS (Platform as a Service)	Provides a ready-to-use environment for developing, running, and managing applications without the complexity of infrastructure management.	Renting an apartment with furniture and utilities included.
SaaS (Software as a Service)	Provides software applications ready for use over the internet. The vendor manages everything.	Renting a fully functional hotel room.
                                               
Deployment Models
•	Public Cloud: Services offered over the public internet by third-party providers (e.g., AWS, Azure, GCP).
•	Private Cloud: Services maintained on a private network for exclusive use by one organization.
•	Hybrid Cloud: A mix of public and private clouds, bound together by technology that allows data and applications to be shared between them.
2. Job Roles and Salary Trends
The demand for professionals who can design, deploy, and manage cloud environments is critically high.
Job Role	Key Responsibility	Expected Entry-Level Salary Range (India)
Cloud Architect	Designs and oversees the entire cloud strategy, ensuring security, scalability, and cost efficiency.	₹12,00,000 – ₹25,00,000+ per annum
Cloud Developer	Builds, deploys, and maintains cloud-native applications using services like serverless functions and containers.	₹6,00,000 – ₹12,00,000 per annum
Cloud Security Engineer	Protects cloud-based systems, infrastructure, and data from threats; ensures compliance.	₹8,00,000 – ₹15,00,000+ per annum
DevOps Engineer	Bridges development and operations using automation tools (like Terraform, Ansible) to deploy applications efficiently in the cloud.	₹7,00,000 – ₹14,00,000 per annum

3. Relevant Certifications (Link to Task 4)
Earning vendor-specific certifications is the fastest way to validate cloud skills, demonstrating practical readiness to employers.
Certification	Provider	Focus Area	Aligns with Role
AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner (CCP)	Amazon Web Services (AWS)	Foundational, high-level understanding of the AWS cloud platform.	Entry-Level/Non-Technical
Microsoft Azure Fundamentals (AZ-900)	Microsoft Azure	Foundational knowledge of cloud services and how Azure provides them.	Entry-Level/Non-Technical
AWS Certified Solutions Architect – Associate (SAA-C03)	Amazon Web Services (AWS)	Designing highly available, cost-efficient, fault-tolerant, and scalable systems.	Cloud Architect, Mid-Level Engineer
Google Cloud Associate Cloud Engineer	Google Cloud Platform (GCP)	Deploying, monitoring, and maintaining projects on Google Cloud.	Cloud Developer, Cloud Engineer

4. Example of an Indian Startup
Startup: Uniphore
•	Domain Focus: Conversational AI and Automation built on cloud infrastructure.
•	Core Business: Provides enterprise-level conversational automation solutions powered by AI, voice, and video.
•	Cloud Application: They rely heavily on cloud computing (IaaS and PaaS, likely across multiple vendors) to process massive amounts of real-time audio/speech data, train and deploy large language models, and scale their services globally to handle peak enterprise customer loads. The cloud provides the necessary elasticity and compute power for their AI models.
